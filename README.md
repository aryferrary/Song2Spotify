This script scans a folder to detect song names from audio files and automatically adds them to a specified Spotify playlist. 
If a song cannot be recognized, the script uses the file name to perform a Spotify search and adds the top matching result to the playlist.


Make sure to download the necessary libraries first. Check your python version. You can contact me on my discord for any questions. Discord: aryferrari
